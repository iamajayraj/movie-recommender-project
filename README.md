    <h1>ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Movie Recommendation System</strong> project! This project leverages data science techniques to build a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on various features like genres, cast, and more. It's hosted as a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.</p>
    
    <h2>ðŸš€ Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project was developed to create a system that recommends movies similar to a user's favorite films. It uses data from the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset, which includes extensive information on movies such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and more.</p>
    
    <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Content-Based Filtering:</strong> Recommends movies based on the content of the movies a user likes.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Extensive preprocessing of movie metadata, including extraction and transformation of genres, keywords, cast, and crew.</li>
        <li><strong>Streamlit App:</strong> An interactive web app to easily get movie recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
